# Elden-Ring-Mod-Engine-2-Launcher

A program that manage your mods for Elden Ring using mod-engine-2's launchmod_eldenring.bat file. If you have couple of mods like I do and separate them but did not want to open file explorer and navigate to specific mod with mod-engine-2. This tool will help and make the process quick.

You will be able to add any mod folder you want to. It just have to have modengine 2 in as it will rely on launchmod_eldenring.bat.

Only expectations is if you move the mod folder to somewhere else or renamed it, you will have to delete and re add the folder. Otherwise it will don't work.

Installation:
- install through the release -> https://github.com/vooidt/Elden-Ring-Mod-Engine-2-Launcher/releases
- unzip it somewhere
- (optional) create shortcut of the EldenRingModLauncher.exe file and place it on desktop
- done!

have fun playing modded elden ring!

Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.
